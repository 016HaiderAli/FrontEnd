        When creating the application, we followed the design and defined specs as we built the actual code. The application was created using the design as a guide and a variety of tools, including compilers (such as Android Studio and Visual Studio Code), a programming language (Dart), an open-source software development toolkit (Flutter), various APIs (such as Google Map and Payment Method), and Firebase for various functionalities, such as login validation, phone validation, and email validation.

    <p><a id="Testing"></a><h3>Testing</h3><br>
        In order to ensure that the end-user experience would not be harmed, an application was tested once it was fully constructed. Building software was not the end of the process. To give users a bug-free and error-free experience, we combed over the software repeatedly during this stage, trying to detect, note, and solve errors as much as possible.
